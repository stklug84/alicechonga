  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">International HR Leader | Workplace Strategist | Global
  Mobility Expert</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <p><strong>I help organizations grow - ethically, sustainably, and across borders.</strong></p>
  <p>For over eight years, I've worked at the intersection of international
  labour migration, people strategy, and organizational culture, supporting
  governments, startups, NGOs, and private firms to build HR systems that work -
  for people and for progress. As an International HR professional, I don't just
  implement processes - I design pathways that elevate human potential, drive
  compliance, and support inclusive development.</p>

  <h3>My Approach: People-First, Globally Grounded</h3>
  <p>Whether deploying skilled workers internationally, advising on bilateral
  labour frameworks, or helping a startup design its first HR manual, I approach
  each challenge with:</p>
  <ul class="approach-list">
    <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> aligning workforce plans with business and
  policy goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> centering people, culture, and fairness in
  every system.</li>
    <li><strong>Global Insight:</strong> grounded in international labour
  standards, migration policy, and cross-cultural HR.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Areas of Expertise</h3>
  <ul class="expertise-list">
    <li><strong>Labour Migration & Global Mobility:</strong> From policy to
  practiceâ€”ethical recruitment, bilateral agreements, and worker
  protection.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Border HR Systems:</strong> HR frameworks for
  international teams, expatriate support, and multi-country compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Startup & NGO HR Support:</strong> Helping small organizations
  build solid HR foundations aligned with mission and scale.</li>
    <li><strong>Workplace Culture & DEI:</strong> Supporting inclusive
  leadership, conflict resolution, and trust-building across teams.</li>
    <li><strong>International Workforce Planning:</strong> Aligning labour
  market trends with talent needs across Africa, Europe, and the Gulf.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>Work is changing - fast. The borders between countries, roles, and cultures
  are more porous than ever. But the values that drive sustainable growth remain
  the same: dignity, purpose, fairness, and opportunity.</p>
  <p>I believe International HR isn't just about solving problems. It's about
  building bridges between people and opportunity, between compliance and
  compassion, between today's systems and tomorrow's potential.</p>

    build ethical, future-ready HR systems, I'd love to collaborate.</p>
