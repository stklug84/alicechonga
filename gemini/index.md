  <h2>Building Bridges for a Global Workforce</h2>
  <p>
    International HR isn't just about solving problems. It's about building
  bridges between people and opportunity, between compliance and compassion,
  between today's systems and tomorrow's potential. My approach is people-first
  and globally grounded, designed to elevate human potential, drive compliance,
  and support inclusive development.
