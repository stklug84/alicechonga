## International HR Leader | Workplace Strategist | Global Mobility Expert

I help organizations grow — ethically, sustainably, and across borders.

For over eight years, I’ve worked at the intersection of international labour migration, people strategy, and organizational culture, supporting governments, startups, NGOs, and private firms.

### My Approach
- **Strategy** — aligning workforce plans with business and policy goals
- **Empathy** — centering people, culture, and fairness in every system
- **Global Insight** — grounded in international labour standards, migration
  policy, and cross-cultural HR

### Areas of Expertise

- Labour Migration & Global Mobility
- Cross-Border HR Systems
- Startup & NGO HR Support
- Workplace Culture & DEI
- International Workforce Planning

**Why It Matters**
Work is changing fast. Borders are more porous than ever, but values like
dignity, fairness, and opportunity remain vital.
